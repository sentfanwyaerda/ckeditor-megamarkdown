CKeditor MegaMarkDown Plug-in
===========
*A fork of the [BBcode plug-in](http://ckeditor.com/addon/bbcode) for [CKeditor](http://ckeditor.com/).*

### What do I call MegaMarkDown?
Well, **MegaMarkdown**, it is a blend of several human-readable markups, with [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) on it's base. Even further extended then [MultiMarkDown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/), with the [GitHub](http://www.github.com/)-flavour. It also adds the deviation [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper) implements and to support multi-lingual content of the [qTranslate](http://www.qianqin.de/qtranslate/)-idea is implimented. In some aspects it also simplifies: ``*bold*``, ``/italic/``, ``_underline_``, ``~strike-through~`` and ``^super-script^``. Also the "standard" [BBcode](https://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php?mode=bbcode) will be supported, hence the plug-in is a fork.

In the configuration of the plug-in you could chooce which flavours you want to allow.

### RoadMap
- *(first)* adapt the BBcode to minimal MarkDown
- .. to be determined
